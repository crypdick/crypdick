### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ricardo Decal. My GitHub activity is quiet these days since I work in industry.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working for [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/), helping companies scale AI workloads using [Ray Distributed](http://ray.io/). Previously I was an MLE at [Dendra](http://dendra.io/), fighting climate change with smart tree-planting drones.
